Student Bank Application Documentation
Overview
The Student Bank Application is a simple Java-based system that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, modification, deletion, balance checks, and money transactions (deposit/withdrawal). This application uses Hibernate ORM for database management and MySQL as the database system. The user interacts with the system through a command-line interface (CLI).

Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language for implementing the application logic.
Hibernate: ORM framework used for database interactions.
MySQL: Relational database system used to store account information.
Eclipse IDE: Development environment used for writing and managing the code.
JDBC: Database connectivity used through Hibernate.
Spring Boot (optional): Can be used to simplify the configuration for the application.
Project Structure
1. AccountDTO22 (DTO - Data Transfer Object)
This class represents the data structure for a bank account. It contains the following properties:

AccNumber: The unique account number.
Balance: The current balance of the account.
Name: The name of the account holder.
PhoneNumber: The phone number associated with the account.
It also includes getters and setters for all these properties, which allow interaction with the account data.

2. BankDAO22 (DAO - Data Access Object)
The BankDAO22 class handles all database-related operations using Hibernate. It includes methods to:

Insert Account Details: Create a new bank account.
Delete Account: Remove an existing bank account from the system.
Modify Account: Change details like the account holder's name or phone number.
Read Account: Retrieve details of an existing account.
Money Transaction: Perform deposit or withdrawal operations on an account.
This class uses Hibernate's Session and Transaction objects to interact with the MySQL database and persist data.

3. App (Main Application)
The App class serves as the entry point of the application. It provides a command-line interface for the user to perform various banking operations. The options provided to the user are:

Create New Bank Account
Delete Account
Modify Account
Check Account Details
Money Transactions (Deposit or Withdraw)
Exit: Exit the application.
The App class interacts with the BankDAO22 class to execute the appropriate banking operations based on the user's choice.

Setup Instructions
1. Install MySQL
Ensure that MySQL is installed on your system. Create a new database named StudentBank to store account information.

2. Set Up Hibernate
Hibernate is configured through the hibernate.cfg.xml file. You need to update the file with your MySQL credentials (username, password) and the correct database URL.

3. Configure the Project
Import the project into your IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
Ensure the required Hibernate dependencies are included in your project.
4. Database Schema
Hibernate will automatically generate the necessary database tables based on the mapping configurations. Ensure that the hbm2ddl.auto property is set to update in the Hibernate configuration file.

Usage
Running the Application
Launch the App class to start the application.
The following options will appear in the console:
Create New Bank Account: Input the account number, name, phone number, and initial balance to create a new account.
Delete Account: Input the account number to delete an existing account.
Modify Account: Modify the name or phone number of an existing account.
Check Account Details: Retrieve account details like name, phone number, and balance.
Money Transaction: Perform deposit or withdrawal operations on an account.
Exit: Exit the program.
Database Interaction
The application uses Hibernate ORM to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the MySQL database.

Hibernate Configuration
hibernate.cfg.xml
This file contains configuration settings for Hibernate, such as the database connection properties, dialect, and the mapping resource (Account.hbm.xml) for the AccountDTO22 class.

Account.hbm.xml
This XML file provides the Hibernate mapping between the AccountDTO22 class and the corresponding database table. It defines the fields and their mappings.

Known Issues
Database Connectivity: Ensure the MySQL server is running and accessible for database operations.
Input Validation: The application does not perform extensive input validation. Be cautious of invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect account numbers or names).
